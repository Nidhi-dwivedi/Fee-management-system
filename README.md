# Fee Management System

This project implements a **Fee Management System** in C++. It includes features for generating fee slips, modifying fee records, displaying a class-wise fee list, and providing a simple user interface for managing school fee data.

## Features

- **Fee Slip Generation**: Generate fee slips for individual classes.
- **Modify Fee Records**: Update tuition, AC, science, computer, and activity fees for any class.
- **View Fee List**: Display the class-wise fee structure.
- **Help Section**: Guidance on how to use the program.
- **Interactive Menu**: A user-friendly menu-driven interface.

## Dependencies

This program relies on the following libraries:
- `<iostream>`: For input/output operations.
- `<windows.h>`: For console-based cursor positioning and animations.
- `<fstream>`: For file handling.
- `<cstring>`: For string manipulations.
- `<cstdlib>`: For standard library utilities.
- `<cstdio>`: For C-style input/output.
- `<cctype>`: For character handling.
- `<conio.h>`: For console input/output operations.
- `<ctime>`: For working with time.
- `<iomanip>`: For formatted output.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository or copy the code into a file named `FeeManagementSystem.cpp`.
2. Open the file in your favorite C++ IDE or editor.
3. Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
4. Run the executable file.

## Usage

1. On running the program, the main menu will be displayed with options:
   - `F`: Generate a Fee Slip.
   - `M`: Modify Fee Records.
   - `L`: Display the Fee List.
   - `H`: Access the Help section.
   - `Q`: Quit the program.

- The program automatically initializes fee records if the file does not exist.

## Program Architecture

### Classes

1. **DRAW**
   - Handles drawing elements in the console such as lines and boxes for the UI.
   
2. **FEE**
   - Manages fee data for classes.
   - Handles fee addition, modification, display, and fee slip generation.

### Functions
